The Bag of Words model represents each text document as a numeric vector where each dimension is a specific word from the corpus and the value could be its frequency in the document, occurrence (denoted by 1 or 0), or even weighted values. The model’s name is such because each document is represented literally as a bag of its own words, disregarding word order, sequences, and grammar."

    "## TF-IDF Model\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some potential problems that might arise with the Bag of Words model when it is used on large corpora. Since the feature vectors are based on absolute term frequencies, there might be some terms that occur frequently across all documents and these may tend to overshadow other terms in the feature set. Especially words that don’t occur as frequently, but might be more interesting and effective as features to identify specific categories. This is where TF-IDF comes into the picture. TF-IDF stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency. It’s a combination of two metrics, term frequency (tf ) and inverse document frequency (idf ). This technique was originally developed as a\n",
    "metric for ranking search engine results based on user queries and has come to be a part of information retrieval and text feature extraction.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  $tfidf = tf  * idf$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where term frequency (tf) and inverse-document frequency (idf) represent the two metrics we just talked about.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Term Frequency (TF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Term frequency in any document vector is denoted by the raw frequency value of that term in a particular document. Mathematically it can be represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $tf (w ,D ) = f_{wD} $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f_{wD}$ denoted frequency for word w in document D, which becomes the term frequency (tf ). Sometimes you can also normalize the absolute raw frequency using logarithms or averaging the frequency. We use the raw frequency in our computations.\n",

We could also perform both of this steps in one step by applying fit_transform on the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, every sklearn's transform's fit() just calculates the relevant parameters (e.g. μ and σ in case of StandardScaler) and saves them as an internal object's state. Afterwards, you can call its transform() method to apply the transformation to any particular set of examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Then why do we need 2 separate methods - fit and transform ?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### We use fit_transform() on the train data so that we learn the parameters of scaling on the train data and in the same time we scale the train data. We only use transform() on the test data because we use the scaling paramaters learned on the train data to scale the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here's why we do like that in detail\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice we need to have a separate training and testing dataset and that is where having a separate fit and transform method helps. We apply fit on the training dataset and use the transform method on both - the training dataset and the test dataset. Thus the training as well as the test dataset are then transformed(scaled) using the model parameters that were learnt on applying the fit method the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important thing here is that when you divide your dataset into train and test sets what you are trying to achieve is somewhat simulate a real world application. In a real world scenario you will only have training data and you will develop a model according to that and predict unseen instances of similar data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you transform the entrire data with fit_transform() and then split to train test you violate that simulation approach and do the transformation according to the unseen examples as well. Which will inevatibly result in an optimistic model as you already somewhat prepared your model by the unseen samples metrics as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you split the data to train test and apply fit_transform() to both you will also be mistaken as your first transformation of train data will be done by train splits metrics only and your second will be done by test metrics only.\n",
    "\n",
    "The right way to do these preprocessings is to train any transformer with train data only and do the transformations to the test data. Because only then you can be sure that your resulting model represents a real world solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(X_train)\n",
    "scaler.transform(X_train)\n",
    "scaler.transform(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that mean and std obtained from the training set are used for scaling all training dataset values. And we should not compute a separate mean and std on the test set to scale the test set values instead we have to use the ones obtained using fit on the training set. We have to ensure identical operation on test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is, once we executed `t.fit(train_data)`, t is fitted, so you can safely use\n",
    "\n",
    "`t.transform(test_data)`\n",
    "\n",
