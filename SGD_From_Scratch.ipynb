    "# Implementing Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier with Logloss and L2 regularization without sklearn\n",

    "The full code is part of my [**this Kaggle Notebook**](https://www.kaggle.com/search#Implementing-SGD-Classifier-with-Logloss-and-L2-regularization-using-SGD-from-scratch-%28WITHOUT-using-sklearn%29)\n",

    "### The Problem with Regular Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, we are familiar with the concept of error and we are generally concerned with minimizing said error by modeling error as a function and defining the optimal model that has the lowest error\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall in linear regression, we were concerned with minimizing the sum of squared residuals. In Calculus, to find the optimal point of a function, we must utilize the **derivative**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In vector (multi-dimensional) calculus, we generalize the concept of the derivative as the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient is the derivative of a single function of all of its variables. We use the gradient in order to create a **directional derivative**. The directional derivative gives us both a direction and magnitude of “how steep” the function is at that point and facing that direction. Our goal is to follow the directional derivatives to find the minimum (or maximum) value of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient descent**, also known as **steepest descent**, is an optimization algorithm for finding the local minimum of a function. To find a local minimum, the function “steps” in the direction of the negative of the gradient. **Gradient ascent** is the same as gradient descent, except that it steps in the direction of the positive of the gradient and therefore finds local maximums instead of minimums. The algorithm of gradient descent can be outlined as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see from plot above that our local minimum is gonna be near around 1.4 or 1.5 (on the x-axis), but let’s pretend that we don’t know that, so we set our starting point (arbitrarily, in this case) at x_0=2\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we follow the negative gradient (negative derivatives?) Because to calculate the directional derivative we must do:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Imgur](https://imgur.com/jWeYkn7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the method above (for regular Gradient Descent) we need to calculate the gradient in every step of our algorithm. In our example , this is not a big deal since there are only a hundred data points. But imagine that we had 2 million data points. If this were the case, it would certainly make the method above far less efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, the algorithm above is often called **batch gradient descent** to contrast it with **mini-batch gradient descent** (which we will not go into here) and **stochastic gradient descent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the regular/classic gradient descent method consists of initially evaluating both the function and its gradient, starting from a configuration chosen randomly in the space of dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we try to move in the direction indicated by the gradient. This establishes a direction of descent in which the function tends to a minimum and examines whether the function actually takes on a value lower than that calculated in the previous configuration. If so, the procedure continues iteratively, recalculating the new gradient. This can be totally different from the previous one. After this, it starts again in search of a new minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "This iterative procedure requires that, at each step, the entire system status is updated. This means that all the parameters of the system must be recalculated. From a computational point of view, this equates to an extremely expensive operating cost and greatly slows down the estimation procedure. With respect to the standard gradient descent method, in which the weights are updated after calculating the gradient for the entire dataset, in the stochastic method, the system parameters are updated after a certain number of examples. These are chosen randomly in order to speed up the process and to try and avoid any local minimum situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a dataset that contains n observations of a phenomenon. Here, let f be an objective function that we want to minimize with respect to a series of parameters x. Here, we can write the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Imgur](https://imgur.com/h8Xh3bW.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the analysis of the previous equation, we can deduce that the evaluation of the objective function f requires n evaluations of the function f, one for each value contained in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the classic gradient descent method, at each step, the function gradient is calculated in correspondence with all the values of the dataset through the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Imgur](https://imgur.com/dWqaeqc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, the evaluation of the sum present in the previous equation can be particularly expensive, such as when the dataset is particularly large and there is no elementary expression for the objective function. The stochastic descent of the gradient solves this problem by introducing an approximation of the gradient function. At each step, instead of the sum of the gradients being evaluated in correspondence to the data contained in the dataset, the evaluation of the gradient is used only in a random subset of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stochastic gradient descent vs classic gradient descent method¶\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the previous equation replaces the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Imgur](https://imgur.com/05iFjt8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "is the gradient of one of the observations in the dataset, chosen randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pros of this technique are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Based only on a part of the observations, the algorithm allows a wider exploration of the parametric space, with the greater possibility of finding new and potentially better points of the minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Taking a step of the algorithm is computationally much faster, which ensures faster convergence toward the minimum point.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The parameter estimates can also be calculated by loading only a part of the dataset into memory at a time, allowing this method to be applied to large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as we said above, in batch gradient descent, we must look at every example in the entire training set on every step (in cases where a training set is used for gradient descent). This can be quite slow if the training set is sufficiently large. In stochastic gradient descent, we update our values after looking at each item in the training set, so that we can start making progress right away. Recall the linear regression example above. In that example, we calculated the gradient for each of the two theta values as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Imgur](https://imgur.com/CXXaQXz.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the sample data had a hundred data points as in the example above, calculating the gradient was not very costly. But for very large data sets, this would not be the case. So instead, we consider a stochastic gradient descent algorithm for simple linear regression such as the following, where m is the size of the data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Imgur](https://imgur.com/KuLQFyL.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, with stochastic gradient descent, you will run through the entire data set 1 to 10 times (see value for k in line 2 of the pseudocode above), depending on how fast the data is converging and how large the data set is.\n",
    "\n",
    "With batch gradient descent, we must go through the entire data set before we make any progress. With this algorithm though, we can make progress right away and continue to make progress as we go through the data set. Therefore, stochastic gradient descent is often preferred when dealing with large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent will tend to oscillate near a minimum value rather than continuously getting closer. It may never actually converge to the minimum though. One way around this is to slowly decrease the step size αα as the algorithm runs. However, this is less common than using a fixed αα.\n",
